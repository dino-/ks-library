- Fill out more of README.md
- It may be time to put info in changelog.md
- Look into accessing CouchBase directly from Haskell
- Is there a different url encoding API than what's in Network.HTTP?
- ks-dlinsp
   - Need arguments for specifying what to download:
        [-s, --start-date yyyymmdd] defaulting to today
        -d, --days  How many days backwards from today
     Will need to compute start/end dates from this for nc_wake
- Ks.Inspection
   - Should we really be using Data.ByteString.Lazy.Char8 for
     saveInspection? Try with just Data.ByteString.Lazy or even
     not lazy.
- Ks.DlInsp.Source.*
   - Replace usage of Network.HTTP with Network.HTTP.Conduit
     (http-conduit). See Ksdl.Geocoding/Places
